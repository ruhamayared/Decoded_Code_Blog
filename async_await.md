<p>Wondering what <code>async/await</code>&nbsp;is and how and when to use it? In this article, I will answer these questions as simply as I can.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Background:</b><br /><code>Async/await</code>&nbsp;is simply a modern way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, making it easier to work with Promises.&nbsp;</p><p>Asynchronous operations are tasks that take some time to complete, like fetching data from an API. In JavaScript, there are other ways to handle asynchronous operations, such as:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><u>Callbacks</u> - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of an asynchronous operation. Callbacks were the primary method for handling asynchronous operations in earlier versions of JavaScript. However, they can lead to issues like "callback hell" when dealing with multiple nested asynchronous operations, making the code difficult to read and maintain.</li><li><u>Promises</u> - Promises are a more modern approach to handling asynchronous operations. A Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation and has three states: pending, fulfilled (resolved), and rejected. Promises can be chained together using .then() and .catch() methods, making the code more readable and easier to maintain than callbacks.</li></ul><div>You can find many examples of Callbacks and Promises if you do some research.</div><p></p><p><code>Async/await</code>&nbsp;is built on top of Promises and further simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations by making the code even more readable and easier to maintain.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Putting <code>async/await</code>&nbsp;into Action:</b><br />When a function is marked as <code>async</code>,&nbsp; it automatically returns a Promise.&nbsp;If an <code>async</code>&nbsp;function contains an <code>await</code>&nbsp; expression, then this promise-returning function behaves as though it is synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the <code>await</code>&nbsp;expression.&nbsp;The <code>await</code>&nbsp;keyword is only valid inside <code>async</code>&nbsp;functions within regular JavaScript code, although it can be used on its own, in other situations.&nbsp;</p><p>So there are three parts to an <code>async</code>&nbsp;function:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><code>async</code>&nbsp;: Tells the function it can work with Promises.</li><li><code>await</code>&nbsp;: Pauses the function to wait for a Promise to finish.</li><li><code>return</code>&nbsp;: Gives a result for the Promise created by the <code>async function.</code>&nbsp;</li></ul>Below is an example of an <code>async/await</code>&nbsp;function that I used to delete a piece of data for a CRUD project that was written in TypeScript.<br /><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTUESsHWkAKmAZe5Gu24kCE42ylamnV_Zxu0eq6Hozxv5hc1GaORD2YQiIKuH3bLwz33YULIsdC06NJ39NBnlTsY4enQ2TiRDwijSCl5Ec4tpjQajLD-iYsmFlhqjNqKb3qYBu365vh2SBv17XXhsU8aTJvD0vrSsFl85rphF3B9FF0KzRNVd0c890fA/s1618/Screenshot%202023-04-03%20at%203.18.23%20PM.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="712" data-original-width="1618" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTUESsHWkAKmAZe5Gu24kCE42ylamnV_Zxu0eq6Hozxv5hc1GaORD2YQiIKuH3bLwz33YULIsdC06NJ39NBnlTsY4enQ2TiRDwijSCl5Ec4tpjQajLD-iYsmFlhqjNqKb3qYBu365vh2SBv17XXhsU8aTJvD0vrSsFl85rphF3B9FF0KzRNVd0c890fA/w680-h300/Screenshot%202023-04-03%20at%203.18.23%20PM.png" width="680" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><div>Remember that these explanations are simplified, and there's more to learn about <code>async</code>&nbsp; functions, <code>await</code>&nbsp;, and Promises as you progress in your coding journey.
